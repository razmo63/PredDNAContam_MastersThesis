## Developing a Machine Learning Model to Estimate Within-Species DNA Contamination.

#### - What is Within-Species DNA Contamination?
###### Within-species DNA contamination occurs when DNA from the same species (e.g., human DNA in a human sample) accidentally ends up in the sample. This can occur during sample collection, preparation, or sequencing. Accurately measuring contamination is important for genetic studies, especially in areas like rare disease research, where accurate  detection of variants is essential.

####  - Data
- ###### **Source**: Human blood samples.
- ###### **Sample Size**: 30 uncontaminated blood samples were used to generate 4000 in-silico samples.
- ###### **Contamination Levels**: The contamination was simulated at 10 different levels: 3%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, and 45%.
